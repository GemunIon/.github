The Gemuinion framework is a salvation for businesses with product development issues. We developed a boxed solution that combines the most used mechanics: stacking, airdrop, craft, vesting, loot-boxing, and collectible traits.

The framework has a modular structure adjustable to your projects while highly integrable with mobile apps based on Unity/Unreal Engine. There are all kinds of QA undertaken to ensure the security and reliability of the project. We also provide comprehensive documentation on our framework.

Gemuinon is capable of being tailored to both B2C and B2B clients. It provides everything a blockchain-driven game requires: from the state-of-art store and game mechanics to loot generation and integration with the 3d party services.
